InvenGlove
==========

An initial prototype of a data glove system for Virtual Assembly. 


InvenGlove captures hand motion and finger flex respectively using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)  and flex sensors.  The gloves is to be interfaced with a PC that runs a small program (InvenGlove Connector). This program interprets the sensors readings into object rotation, translation and zoom control inside Autodesk Inventor.

Minimum hardware requirements (barebone):


1x Arduino Mini Pro

2x SpectraSymbol Flex Sensor

1x HC 05 Bluetooth Module

1x InvenSense MPU 9150 Breakout board





(see Eagle PCB schematics and the codes for now, proper documentation should be available soon.)

InvenGlove is part of capstone project on Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia. Released under GNU GPL v3
