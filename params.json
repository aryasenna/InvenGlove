The gloves is to be interfaced with a PC that runs an small program (InvenGlove Connector). This program interprets the sensors readings into object rotation, translation and zoom control inside Autodesk Inventor.\r\n\r\nMinimum hardware requirements (barebone):\r\n\r\n\r\n1x Arduino Mini Pro\r\n\r\n2x SpectraSymbol Flex Sensor\r\n\r\n1x HC 05 Bluetooth Module\r\n\r\n1x InvenSense MPU 9150 Breakout board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(see Eagle PCB schematics and the codes for now, proper documentation should be available soon.)\r\n\r\nInvenGlove is part of capstone project on Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.
